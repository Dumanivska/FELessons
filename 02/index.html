              The <b>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</b> is a cattle herding dog breed that
              originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is one of two breeds known
              as a Welsh Corgi. Pembroke Welsh Corgis descended from the Spitz
              family of dogs. The other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi,which
              descend from the Teckel family of dogs, which also produced the
              Dachshund.

              Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famous as the preferred breed of Queen
              Elizabeth II,who has owned more than 30 Royal corgis during her
              reign.Although these dogs have been favoured by British royalty
              for more than seventy years, among the British public they have
              recently fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand.
              However, they remain very popular in the United States. Cities
              such as New York,Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco hold
              annual "Corgi Meetups" in which hundreds of dogs and their owners
              congregate to spend the day.

              The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked 11th in Stanley Coren's
              The Intelligence of Dogs, which states that the breed is
              considered an excellent working dog. Pembroke Welsh Corgis were
              ranked 11th most popular breed of dog in 2020 according to the
              American Kennel Club.

          The Pembroke Welsh Corgi lineage has been traced back as far as 1107
          AD.It is said that Flemish weavers brought the dogs with them as they
          traveled to reside in Wales. Some popular stories give Corgis a
          creation myth connected to fairies. One story states that two children
          were running through a forest and stumbled upon the funeral of a
          fairy. The mourning fairies gave the two children two small corgi
          puppies and the children took them home, thus giving the breed
          popularity.[citation needed] Stories also state that Corgis played the
          role of war horses for fairies before they became herding dogs for
          humans. At the base of the haunches of Corgis, there is a line of
          slightly rougher fur called the fairy saddle. Rather than Welsh lore,
          this may be a modern myth sparked by corgi breeders of the 1940s.
          Pembrokes and Cardigans first appeared together in 1925 when they were
          shown under the rules of The Kennel Club in Britain. The Corgi Club
          was founded in December 1925 in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire.[21] It is
          reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club
          for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year or so later.Both groups
          have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are
          standardized through careful selective breeding.Pembrokes and
          Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and
          were initially categorized together under the single heading of Welsh
          Corgis before the two breeds were recognized as separate and distinct
          in 1934. Corgi at 4 months, when they are starting to get their
          typical fawn colour. The ears look too big compared to their head.
          Pembroke Welsh Corgis are becoming more popular in the United States
          and rank 20th (24th) in American Kennel Club registrations, as of 2015
          (2012). However, corgis are now listed as a "vulnerable" breed in the
          United Kingdom; the decline has been said to be due to a 2007 ban on
          tail-docking (the practice of cutting off the animal's tail) in the
          U.K., as well as the lack of breeders in the U.K.In 2009, the corgi
          was added to The Kennel Club's "At Watch" list of British breeds when
          annual registrations numbered between 300 and 450. In 2014, the breed
          was put on the Club's "Vulnerable Native Breeds" list when
          registrations dropped under 300.In 2018, the breed came off the
          "At-Risk" list with 456 puppies registered in December 2017. The
          Kennel Club has credited the renewed interest in the breed to the
          popular Netflix television series, The Crown, and others.The Pembroke
          Welsh Corgi has also appeared in the American television Brooklyn
          Nine-Nine as the pet dog of Captain Raymond Holt and Kevin M. Cozner
          and is shown to be extremely loyal. Ein, a Corgi with human-level
          intelligence, is one of the 5 main characters in the TV show Cowboy
          Bebop.

          Pembrokes have an average life expectancy of 12–15 years.Pembroke
          Welsh Corgis are achondroplastic, meaning they are a "true dwarf"
          breed. As such, their stature and build can lead to certain
          non-inherited health conditions, but genetic issues should also be
          considered. Commonly, Pembrokes can suffer from monorchidism, Von
          Willebrand's disease, hip dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy (DM), and
          inherited eye problems such as progressive retinal atrophy. Genetic
          testing is available for Pembroke Welsh Corgis to avoid these issues
          and enhance the genetic health pool. Pembrokes are also prone to
          obesity given a robust appetite, characteristic of herding group
          breeds.

          Pembroke Welsh Corgis can compete in dog agility trials, obedience,
          showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts
          and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding
          tests.Corgis, despite their dwarfism giving the illusion of small slow
          legs, can reach up to 25 mph if they are healthy and fit. This is
          because Corgis tend to use more upper body strength to run than most
          dogs, giving them enhanced abilities with such activities as agility
          and herding and racing.

        <h3>Royal corgis</h3>

        At a young age, the Queen's passion for this breed started when her
        father, King George VI, brought home their first royal corgi who was
        later named Dookie.The Queen ceased breeding corgis around 2012 so as
        not to leave any behind after she dies; her last corgi, Willow, died in
        April 2018. She was gifted two new corgi pups by her family in 2021. On
        April 3 2019, the film
        <i>The Queen's Corgi</i> was released.
