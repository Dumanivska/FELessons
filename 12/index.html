          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
          looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to their own
          section. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation,
          Native Components, React, and more!

          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
          applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With
          React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
          well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
          components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more
          about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components
          work in React Native.

          React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building
          user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it
          helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or
          can serve as a refresher course.

          + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
          examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe
          to work in.
        </div>
        <div>
          + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
          elements inside JavaScript like so:
          <span><Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text></span
          >.
        </div>
        <div>
          The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to
          learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables
          inside it. Here you are declaring a <span>name</span> for the cat, name, and
          embedding it with curly braces inside <div><Text></div>
        </div>
        <div>+ props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</div>
        <div>
          + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to
          configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal
          data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
          or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
          memory!

        </div>
        <div>
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
          has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time
          the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
          be called when the text is submitted.
        </div>
        <div>
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
          their words into a different language. In this new language, every
          single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there
          Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
